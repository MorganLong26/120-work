# Homework 5 Animation and Variables

For this assignment I created a monster or cyclops whose arms move back and forth when the mouse is moving around the screen. I also have it set so that you are almost painting with the mouse and the cyclops. Lastly, I have a continuous spinning red orb in the corner of the screen, so even if the mouse isn't moving the orb still is.

## Homework Steps
- I first went through all of the tabs and watched the videos provided.
- Then I began the project in atom.
- I used the course website as a reference if I ran into any troubles.

### Problems
I had a hard time getting my orb to spin continuously, but I eventually figured it out. I went to the course website and found out that I had to use var in front so it would be able to work. I did look at the issue form initially to see if anyone was having the same issue as me, but didn't find anything. I ended up going back to the course website for help.
