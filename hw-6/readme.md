# Algorithmic Sketch

For this assignment I was inspired by circles. I wanted to create something that looking like someone painting brush strokes across the screen without someone having to touch the mouse. I created five circles moving in repeated motion up the screen at random, and this gives the illusion of brush strokes. I also have a white circle going across the bottom of the screen that is always turning colors from white to black. This circle also cuts the other five going up the screen.

## How I Approached this assignment
- I first began by going to the course website and going through all of the tabs and if there was a video I would watch it.
- Second while I was going through the tabs I began to set up my work station in atom, and began to mess around with the new math we learned this assignment.
- After going through all of the sections I really got into the assignment. If I had any issues or confusion I just referred back to the course website.
- Lastly, I submitted everything to the proper place once I completed the assignment.

### Issues
This was by far the toughest assignment for me. It took me a little bit to wrap my head around all of the new math functions and math operators. After several failed attempts I finally got some things that I was trying to do. I had to change up my assignment because part of what I was trying to do wasn't working, but I figures out a different approach. When I submitted this assignment no one had posted any questions, but if more come up after the submission of this assignment I will try to answer them.
