# Final Project
For my final project I wanted to do a fractal tree. My original idea was to do a fractal tree growing from the bottom of the screen, but upon watching a tutorial video on fractal trees, by The Coding Train, I changed my idea. I wanted to have a slider so the user could chose what they wanted the final tree to look like. The slider is off to the right hand side. I liked how festive the fractal tree looked and I like the thought of the image being interactive. I stuck with simple colors such as black and white. I have at the top of the screen floating like clouds to give off a storm or a changing of season, and I have them slowly moving off the screen. Eventually there is only one orb in the sky and I like to think of it as the moon when it gets to that point. This is another reason why I chose to have a slider. When the user moves the slider from side to side it gives a feeling of the changing of seasons. For this project I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and use more objects because I needed more practice using them. I also wanted to do something with a complex shape such as a fractal tree.

## Work Process
- I first began by doing research and finding tutorials to help me better understand how to create my image.
- I then went to the course website to see the full requirements of this project.
- I began my project after reviewing all of the tutorials and the course website.
- I incorporated objects and arrays because that is what I really need to work on.
- Once I finished I submitted my links to moodle and pushed everything to GitHub.

## Issues
I definitely pushed myself for this last project. It took me a while to fully grasp how to make the fractal tree and what all of the lines of code meant. The objects and arrays in general were still difficult for me during this project. I do feel more comfortable with them, but I still struggle. Overall I am happy with my finished product.














# Final Project Proposal
For my final project I want to stray away from the ellipses. I was watching more of the man that runs the Youtube channel The Coding Train, and one of his coding challenge videos inspired my final project. I want to create a fractal tree that either grows from the bottom or the screen and looses its leaves or just have a fractal tree and have snow falling. The Coding Train Youtube channel is serving as inspiration, and he has several different examples of fractal trees. The designs are simplistic but very pretty and unique.
## Problems
In his videos for making these fractal trees he explains that the more you want the tree to do you'll want to use objects. I really struggle with the object function in coding, so I am going to give myself plenty of time just in case I run into any issues. I really wanted to do something with objects for my final project because I feel like I need more practice and that I haven't fully grasped the concept of objects.
## Work Plan
My work plan is for the week of November 26th to the 30th I do the majority, if not all, of the project. Each day I plan on spending time on the project. The first few days I plan on getting the basics and then once I have that finished I will move into the more complicated parts. So far this week I have done my research on what I want to do for my project, and I have been watching serval tutorials on objects, so I can get a better grasp on the concept. Tomorrow I plan on beginning my final sketch.
