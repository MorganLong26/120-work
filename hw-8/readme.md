# Assignment 8 read.me

For this project I wanted to create an abstract design. I haven't really made anything with lines, I have mostly been using ellipses, so I wanted to do something utilizing lines. I had the idea of doing a grid that formed diamond shapes instead of squares. I didn't want to make thee whole canvas the diamond grid, so I left the bottom left corner just one direction of lines. I liked the break from the grid. I used the for looping to achieve this look.

## Work Process
- I first began by going on the course web page and reading all of the tabs that explain how to do the assignment.
- Then I began my project and I referred back to the course website if I had any difficulties.
- When I finished my assignment I completed the read.me and pushed all of my work to GitHub.
- Lastly, I submitted all of my links to the appropriate places.

### Questions
If I had any issues I always went back to the course website and the website answered all of my questions. The only issue I ran into was when I tried to implement the "i". I couldn't get it to work, so I tried the other way without the "i" and it worked much better. At the time of turning this in no one posted any questions or issues on our issue board.
