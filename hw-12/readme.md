# Assignment 12
This week I wanted my live sketch to appear as a firework. I set up the code so when you hit the refresh an explosion of orbs goes across the screen and disappears in a random order like a firework. I have the size of the orbs all different again like a firework. I couldn't get the orbs to change colors so I just kept it white.

## Work Process
- I first began by going to the course web site and reviewing all new material.
- Then I brain stormed an idea, but I really struggled this week so I had to restart and rethink of an idea.
- When I ran into issues I referred back to the course website and posted on the issue board.
- Once I figured out my mistake I thought of a different concept.
- Once completed with that I posted my assignment on GitHub and submitted my links to moodle.

## Issues
This week was the hardest week for me so far. It was difficult for me to wrap my head around all the new things we had to incorporate in order for the objects to interact with one another. I tried to figure it out myself, but I couldn't pin point where I was going wrong. I then posted on the issue board and @JoleneTiffanyG pointed out that I was doing my project the same way as last week, so I wasn't doing the right functions in order to have them interact with each other. Once I figured that out I was able to have them react with one another.
