# Assignment 11
For this assignment I wanted to have floating orbs all around the screen. I wanted them to vibrate and almost appear to have a glow about them while they moved about the screen. To achieve this I started with defining an array variable called ball, and then in the function set up I created the code for the array. Then I moved to the function draw and created the code that makes the array appear. After that I created the new class for orbs, and I added a movement and a show. Lastly, I created the code for the ellipses.

## Work Process
- I began by going onto the course website and reviewing all of the new course material.
- After reviewing, going through all the tabs, and videos I began my project.
- While doing my project I would refer back to the website if I had any issues.
- I did run into some complications, so I posted on the course issue board and got help right away.
- Crisis averted I finished my project, pushed my things to GitHub and submitted my links to moodle.

## Issues
This week I struggled a bit. While in the middle of my project I went to see what the live sketch looked like and nothing was showing up. I tried to figure it out by myself, but ended up not being able to pin point where I went wrong. I then went on our class issue board and posted my problem. A fellow classmate helped me with my predicament, and it turns out that my class and array had the same name so it was not showing up. I made the changes and it worked!
