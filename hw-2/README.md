## Week One Cycle

``- For this week I downloaded all of the programs and software needed to complete this assignment. I was not familiar with anything about this whole process. I just followed all of the instructions, so I was able to complete this assignment successfully.``

Steps I took in completing this assignment
1. Went to class website and went through all of the tabs and videos.
2. I then downloaded all of the necessary programs and software to complete the task.
3. Then I followed along with the instructions until I completed the assignment.

I did not have any questions. When I did have an issue I went to the [class website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-2/markup/)  for reference, and that helped me quite a bit.

There is nothing in particular that I need to discuss further. Everything was fairly straight forward. At the time of doing this assignment either no one posted needing help, or someone was already helping them.
