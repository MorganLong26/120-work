# Arrays and Functions
For this assignment I decided to change an existing project. The project I chose was from assignment 6. For assignment six I had several different color circles repeating themselves till they ran off the page. For this assignment I wanted to make it appear as if the circles were glowing, so I added a new function that drew a line around those existing circles. The purple line drawn around the circles give off a glowing appearance. Then I wanted to have a big circle in the far right corner where the majority of the circles originated for. To create that I did another function called drawCircle. For the array portion of the project I wanted to keep it in the realm of circles. I created an array that goes across the bottom part of the screen that shows orange circles gradually getting larger.

## Process
- I first began by going on the course website and reviewing all of the given tabs for arrays and fuctions.
- I then chose which project I wanted to change.
- Once the old assignment was chosen I began the project. I knew I wanted to work with circles since the original project was dealing with all ellipses.
- If I had any issues during the duration of this project I referred back to the course website.
- Lastly, I completed the readme and submitted everything to GitHub, and turned in all of my links to moodle.

## Issues
I didn't have any issues with this assignment. The course website links and videos were enough help to figure any problems out. At the time of submission there was no one who posted any questions on the GitHub issue page.
